# Salmon ButtStroke (Salmon_BS)

Salmon Buttstroke is an unofficial modification for ArmA3 that adds lightweight melee to the game. The goal is to allow the mod to be fully client side whilst keeping any effects, animations, and functionality fully compatible with those not running the mod. 

## Features:
* Buttstroke.
* Pistol whip.
* Settings for friendly fire on/off.
* Settings for ragdoll on/off.
* Function for usage with AI (Untested, required serverSide installation).
* Fully working animations from A3. Meaning every player, even those without the mod, will see the gloriousness. 
* One keybind does all. 

## Dependencies:
* CBA_A3 - 3.8.0 - https://github.com/CBATeam/CBA_A3
* ACE3 - 3.12.3 - https://github.com/acemod/ACE3

## Bugs:
* Ragdoll might not function properly 100% of the time, not enough info. 
* Dragging someone after knocking them out has been reported to result in the person being able to wake up, still attached to the dragger.
* Possibly getting out of anims, stuck in anims and could be abused to bypass restraint scripts etc.
* Certain weapons could cause animation to look goofy (IE: 3rd party bullpup rifles).
* Sync with knockout and animation a bit off for gameplay purposes (Might be fixed soon with setAnimSpeed).
